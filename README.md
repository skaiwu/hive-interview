# How to test this application

Currently, this project uses the basic create-react-application template, and as a result, to run the code
simply open up the terminal and run npm start or any similar commands.  All the code is stored in the 
select-menu folder, which is the component for the menu that is rendered in App.js.  Both style sheet and 
Javascript file that I did most of my changes in are in Menu.js and Menu.css.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
